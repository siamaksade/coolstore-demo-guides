### Explain the Demo Concepts

* Explain the CoolStore microservices application using https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1bc4f4b598_0_307[these slides]
* Explain the CoolStore deployment pipeline and application promotion process using https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1bc4f4b598_0_184[these slides]
* Explain the projects in the demo
** *Developer Project*: developer's personal project for creating on-demand deployments
** *Inventory TEST*: test environment for the *Inventory* microservice in order to run integration tests
** *CoolStore TEST*: test environment for the *CoolStore* application with all services deployed to run user-acceptrance and system tests
** *CoolStore PROD*: production environment for the *CoolStore* application with all services deployed 
** *CI/CD*: continuous delivyer components such as Jenkins, Gogs, etc

### Demonstrate Automated Deployments via CI/CD Pipelines
* In the OpenShift web console, go to *CI/CD* project
* On the left sidebar menu, click on *Builds* and then *Pipelines*
* Explain that *inventory-pipeline* is an OpenShift pipeline that takes
any change committed to the *coolstore-microservices* team Git repository
through various steps until it is deployed in production.
* Explain that the pipeline was triggered when team member (code reviewer) merged the _Pull Request_ in
the repository. The pipeline has taken the code changes through DEV
environment and after test succeeded, it has promoted the changes to the
TEST environment to run system-integration tests with all dependent
services deployed. When tests succeed, then the new version is promoted
to the PROD parallel to the existing version that is serving customers .
It is waiting for the release managers manual approval to Go Live and
redirect the production traffic to the new version. The manual approval
is typically integrated into existing IT workflow management services
such as ServiceNow, EMC Remedy and JIRA Service Desk. In ChatOps, this
step would be integrated into Slack or other chat systems and would be
controlled via a chat bot. In this demo, we will use Jenkins directly to
approve deployments.

* Explain zero-downtime deployment via Blue/Green deployment strategy using
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1bc4f4b598_0_102[these sides] and
how every minute of downtime for an e-commerce company equals lost revenue.
* Explain that when the pipeline is waiting for a manual approval to Go Live, the 
changes are already deployed in production but user traffic is not switched to the 
new version and that would happen after approval.
* Click on the projects drop-down list on top of the page and then on
*CoolStore PROD*

* Scroll down to the *Inventory* service
* Explain that there are two version of inventory deployed in
production: *inventory-blue* and *inventory-green*. The traffic split shows
that 100% of traffic is going to *inventory-blue* and 0% is going to
*inventory-green*. Comparing the image ids you can see that they are running 
different versions of the inventory service. That's because the changes 
are deployed into to the *inventory-green* while *inventory-blue* still 
runs the previous version and receives all the traffic not to affect production 
customers before the changes are verified to work as expected in production. Note that 
adjusting the traffic split between *inventory-blue* and *inventory-green* to other ratios (for example
90% and 10%) allows performing other deployment patterns such as canary
release or even A/B testing.

* In the *Inventory Live* service group, click on the route URL to open the Swagger UI in a new tab
* Explain that Swagger UI is integrated into the service in order to allow testing the REST
endpoints

image::msa-cicd-eap-swagger.png[Swagger UI,width=820,align=center]

* Click on *GET /availability/{itemId}* to open the API block and enter _165613_ in the
*itemId* field to be used as the API parameter. Click on *Try it out!*
* Explain that the REST response is displayed on the screen in addition to details of how
to use `curl` to call the API
* Explain that the live service is still the previous version and shows the recalled product is in-stock

* Go back to *OpenShift Web Console* browser tab
* In the *Web UI* service group, click on the route URL to open it in a new tab
* Explain that the recalled product (Solid Performance Polo) is still
shows up in-stock on the CoolStore and is possible to order the product.

* Explain that when *Go Live* is approved, the router switches the
traffic to the inventory-green that holds the new version of *Inventory*
service. If not approved, the *Live* version stays the same as before and
the new version gets discarded.
* Click on the *Input Required* link under the *Approve Go Live* stage. Jenkins opens in a new tab.
* Explain that Jenkins can integrate into OpenShift authorization mechanism so that
users can log in using their OpenShift credentials.
* Log in using your OpenShift credentials
* Explain that in Jenkins, you can enable role-based authorization and
people with correct privileges will be able to approve going live in
production
* Click on *Proceed* button to approve the *Go Live*. The Jenkins page shows
the pipeline logs as it proceeds.
* Go back to OpenShift web console, click on the projects drop-down list
on top of the page and then on *CI/CD*. On the left sidebar menu, click on
*Builds* and then *Pipelines*.
* Explain that the pipeline is finished successfully and the new version
is Live now

* In the OpenShift web console, click on *CoolStore PROD* project
* In the *Inventory Live* service group, click on the route URL to open the Swagger UI in a new tab
* Click on *GET /availability/{itemId}* to open the API block and enter _165613_ in the
*itemId* field to be used as the API parameter. Click on *Try it out!*
* Explain that the live service is updated and the recalled product is out-of-stock

image::msa-cicd-eap-swagger-after.png[Recalled Product In-Stock,width=820,align=center]

* In the *Web UI* service group, click on the route URL in a new tab
* Explain that the the recalled product is out of stock.
