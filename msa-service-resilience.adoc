### Explain the Demo Concepts

* Explain service resilience using https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1bbea827f3_0_199[the slides]
* Explain the use-case: services do fail. Sometimes there are temporary
shortages in the infrastructure and sometimes its a severe application
error that leads to failure. Its not a question if that happens, its a
matter of when. Applications and infrastructure needs to design for
service failure and limit the scope of failure in order to keep
providing the service even though some services might not function
properly. As an example, if the Inventory service fails that could lead
to the entire CoolStore web failing and preventing customers from
placing orders. When build for failure, Inventory failure would be
limited to the inventory status and would allow users to keep placing
orders without knowing about the inventory.


### Demonstrate Container Lifecycle Management
{% if modules.msa-cicd-eap %}

* Explain OpenShift container health management using
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1b95a791a8_0_24[the slides]
* In the OpenShift web console, go to *CoolStore PROD* project
* Scroll down to find the *Inventory* group
* Explain that the blue circle shows the number containers that back *inventory-blue* service

====
CAUTION: *Inventory* routes traffic to *inventory-green* and *inventory-blue* services. All traffic by
default is sent to *inventory-blue* and in the rest of this section is mentioned as the active service.
If all traffic is sent to *inventory-green* in your environment, perform the instructions on *inventory-green* instead.
====

* Click on the up arrow to scale the inventory-blue container with 100% traffic to two containers.
* Explain that in a few seconds, a new identical container is deployed
and added automatically to the load-balancer. If one container fails,
there will be another container that can service requests

image::msa-resilience-scaled-bg.png[Scaled Up,width=800,align=center]

* Click on the blue circle
* Explain that the list of pods backing the *inventory-blue* is displayed
* Click on one of the containers with a name similar to *inventory-blue-n-nnnnn*
* Explain that you can see the pod details such as
** The container image that is deployed
** The host that container is deployed on
** Persistent storage attached to the container
** Memory and CPU configurations
** Health and number of times its restarted +
* Click on *Actions* button and then *Delete* to delete this pod

image::msa-resilience-delete-pod-bg.png[Delete Pod,width=920,align=center]

* Click on *Overview* in the left sidebar menu
* Explain that OpenShift immediately realizes that number of pods
backing the *Inventory Blue* service is reduced to 1 while it was declared
to have 2 pods backing this service for high-availability. OpenShift
restarts the removed pod in order to bring the number of pods back to 2 pods.

image::msa-resilience-auto-healing-bg.png[Auto Healing,width=800,align=center]

* Explain that OpenShift allows distinguishing between failures that
might resolve with a restart and more severe issues that need required
further investigation. In latter cases, OpenShift is able to remove
those pods from the load-balancer and send user to the healthy
containers

### Demonstrate Service Resilience and Preventing Cascading Failures

* Explain service resilience using
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g20ea0141cf_0_132[the slides]
* Click on *Web UI* route: {{COOLSTORE_WEB_PROD_URL}}

image::msa-resilience-web-inventory.png[Inventory Service,width=600,align=center]

* Explain the inventory number displayed near each product coming from the inventory service
* Go back to OpenShift Web Console and click on *Hystrix Dashboard* route URL and click on *Monitor Stream* button: {{HYSTRIX_PROD_URL}}

image::msa-resilience-hystrix.png[Hystrix Dashboard,width=800,align=center]

* Explain that *Hystrix* is one of the components in *Netflix OSS* which implements
the circuit breaker pattern. There are 3 circuits in the *Coolstore GW* service where
API calls are made to the *Cart*, *Catalog* and *Inventory* back-end services. The circuit-breaker
protects the gateway against cascading failures and black-lists failing back-ends for a configurable
period of time so that services don't slow down because of back-end services failing. A fallback mechanism
can be provided which tells *Hystrix* what to do instead of calling the failing back-end whenever the
circuit for that specific back-end is *Open*. After a configuration amount of time, calls will be sent
again to the back-end service with the hope that the service is recovered.

image::msa-resilience-hystrix-circuits.png[Hystrix Dashboard,width=800,align=center]

* Go back to OpenShift Web Console and click twice on the down arrow on *inventory-green* pods blue circle. Click
on *Scale Down* button when it asks for confirmation in order to scale to 0
* Go to *Web UI* again and refresh the page: {{COOLSTORE_WEB_PROD_URL}}
* Explain that the inventory number has disappeared from the *CoolStore* since the back-end service is
down, however the store does not fail because of that and continues to allow customers make orders despite
the partial reduced functionality.

image::msa-resilience-web-inventory-down.png[Inventory Service Down,width=600,align=center]

* Refresh the *Coolstore Web UI* multiple times (at least 5 times!)
* Go back to OpenShift Web Console and click on *Hystrix Dashboard* route URL again and click on *Monitor Stream* button: {{HYSTRIX_PROD_URL}}
* Explain that since the *Inventory* service is down, the inventory circuit in *Coolstore GW* has become *Open* which means it has been
blacklisted for a period of time and no calls would be made to the *Inventory* service during that period.

image::msa-resilience-hystrix-circuits-open.png[Hystrix Dashboard,width=800,align=center]

* Refresh *Hystrix Dashboard*
* Explain that after a period of time (5 seconds in this demo), the circuit becomes *Closed* again and the *Inventory*
service is removed from the blacklist. Expectedly, further failures would *Open* the circuit again.

* Go back to OpenShift Web Console and click on up arrow near *inventory-green* to scale the *Inventory*
service back up to 1.
