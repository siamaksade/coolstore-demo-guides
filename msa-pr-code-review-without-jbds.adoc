### Explain the Demo Concepts

* Explain the quality process with Git fork and pull-request process using https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bt4k9yB0wDOj0d5WzDCWqftPxIizQ7f5S15LysEGFyQ/edit#slide=id.g1b05a1839c_2_0[the slides]

* Explain the use-case: one of our vendors has recalled a number of products from our 
online shop. We are working to remove the products from our backoffice system that handles 
inventory however it is an old ERP system and it takes a while till it is removed from the system. 
Since having the products online would need us to pay financial damage to the vendor due to our 
contract, we have decided to update the *Inventory* service that proxies calls to the backoffice ERP 
system to return zero inventory for those specific products until the backoffice system is updated.


### Demonstrate Storing Code Changes in Git Repository

* Explain that the developer should commit the code changes to his Git
repository to be able to shared them for code-review with the team

====
NOTE: *Gogs* git server is used in this demo as the Git repository and it is deployed in the *CI/CD*
project and accessible at {{GOGS_URL}}. Open *Gogs* in your browser in a new tab by entering the
correct URL. Alternatively, click on *OpenShift Container Platform* logo in the header,
then on *CI/CD* project and then on *Gogs* route URL to open *Gogs* in a new tab.
====

* Explain *Gogs* as the team source repository where the CoolStore
application source code and configuration is stored and managed
* In *Gogs* web, click on *Sign In* and enter the developer credentials
** Username: _{{GOGS_DEV_USER}}_
** Password: _{{GOGS_DEV_PASSWORD}}_

* In *My Repositories*, click on *coolstore-microservices* repository
* Browse the git repository to get to {{GOGS_DEV_REPO_URL_PREFIX}}/src/master/inventory-service/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/InventoryService.java[`inventory-service\src\main\java\com\redhat\coolstore\service\InventoryService.java`]

* Click on the edit icon to open {{GOGS_DEV_REPO_URL_PREFIX}}/_edit/master/inventory-service/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/InventoryService.java[`InventoryService.java`] in the text editor

* Remove the `//` from the commented lines to uncomment them

* Enter `Issue #312 fixed` in the field in the *Commit Changes* section and then click on
*Commit Changes* button

image::msa-dev-gogs-commit.png[Commit Changes,width=920,align=center]

* Explain that the changes are committed to the Git repository in order to show the recalled products out-of-stock

* Click on the green compare button to see the
differences between the developer Git repository and the teams Git
repository

image::msa-dev-pullrequest.png[Create Pull Request,width=1000,align=center]

* Scroll down and explain that the only change is the code you committed
to the Git repository in the previous steps
* Specify +Issue #312 fixed+ in the *Title* field and click on *Create Pull Request* button
* Explain that the the _Pull Request_ is created now and the developer and
can discuss the changes with code-reviewers in form of comments on this
_Pull Request_ page

### Demonstrate Code Review Process

* Click on *User profile and more* icon and then *Sign Out*

image::msa-dev-signout.png[Sign Out,width=460,align=center]

* Explain that you will login as a senior code reviewer with privileges
to commit code to the team repository
* In *Gogs* web, click on *Sign In* and enter the team credentials to log in as a code reviewer
** Username: _{{GOGS_REVIEWER_USER}}_
** Password: _{{GOGS_REVIEWER_PASSWORD}}_

* In *My Repositories*, click on *coolstore-microservices* repository
* Explain that the team repository does not contain the changes made by
the developer since they are not reviewed yet. Point out the last commit
which is different from the commit developer made in previous steps
* Explain that there is one _Pull Request_ waiting on the repository to be
reviewed
* Click on the *Pull Request* tab and then on the *Issue #312 fixed* _Pull Request_

image::msa-dev-pullrequests.png[Pull Requests,width=1000,align=center]

* Explain that code-reviewer can study the changes made by looking at
the *Commits* and *Files changed* tabs and comment on the changes
* Write a comment with ++1+ as the message and click on the
*Comment* button to show your approval
* Explain that in different teams, there are different conventions on
how many ++1+s a _Pull Request_ should have to be eligible for merge to the
team repository. In our demo, one is enough!
* Click on *Merge Pull Request* button to merge the code changes to the
team repository

image::msa-dev-pr-comments.png[Pull Request Comments,width=800,align=center]

* Click on *Commits* tab
* Explain that the team repository now contains the changes the
developer made via his forked Git repository
